# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning
Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio, where I showcase my expertise in machine learning within the field of data science. This collection of projects demonstrates my proficiency in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, with a comprehensive workflow that includes data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training and testing. Each project highlights my ability to ensure data quality, uncover hidden patterns, and develop and evaluate machine learning models. I invite you to explore this repository and discover my applications of machine learning in data science - feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.
